# percetron-overweight
Perceptron to classify the people's overweight by scaling the data

Use the perceptron to learn the concept of being overweight:

1. Create random data of people (weight and height) and decide if they are overweight using the BMI formula.
2. Normalize the data (with the method of your choice).
3. Train the perceptron.
4. Test with new data (remember that to get them to the perceptron they must be normalized before)
